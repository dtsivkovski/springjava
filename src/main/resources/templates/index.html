                                <li>DevOps. Java programmers should have a passion for managing the environment and learning automation (Linux, Maven, Deployment).</li>
                                <li>Git/GitHub.  Learning to master change in programming with multiple developers, forks or branches, pull requests.</li>
                                <li>REST services.   Using frameworks to master sharing data, coders can should create and consume RESTful APIs</li>
                                <li>Microservices can be an extension of RESTful Web services or other frameworks with the objective being to break up your code into small, distributed, and independent services.</li>
                                <li>Java 9-18. Java 8 is College Board standard.  Things like Jigsaw, Reactive Streams, APIs, HTTP2 client, JShell, React JS are all more recent advents in Java</li>
