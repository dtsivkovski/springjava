## Spring Java Backend for DADY Academy Tools

This is a backend intended to house all of the API functionality for the DADY Academy tools website. This includes JWT login, Physics/Stats/Bio/Chemistry APIs, and other backend tools.

Credit to [John Mortensen](https://github.com/jm1021) for the template for this backend website, which included an already set up Spring web environment.
